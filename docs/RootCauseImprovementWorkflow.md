# Root Cause Improvement Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The Root Cause Improvement Workflow is a Human-In-The-Loop AI Assistant interface designed to help healthcare professionals analyze and optimize healthcare processes. This tool combines process mining techniques with AI-assisted analysis to identify bottlenecks, analyze common pathways, and provide recommendations for process improvements.

## Key Features

### Process Management
- View and filter processes by status (New, In-Progress, Completed)
- Filter processes by location, type, and date range
- Select processes to view detailed information and analysis

### AI-Assisted Analysis
- Interactive chat interface for asking questions about selected processes
- Automated insights about process bottlenecks and common pathways
- Recommendations for process optimization based on OCEL (Object-Centric Event Log) data

### Process Documentation
- Document analysis findings
- Export and publish analysis results
- Track process improvements over time

## Interface Components

### Filters Section
Located at the top of the page, the filters section allows users to narrow down the displayed processes:

1. **Location Filter**: Select a specific hospital or healthcare facility
2. **Process Type Filter**: Filter by process categories (e.g., Reported Barriers, Admission Process)
3. **Date Range Filter**: Filter processes by date range

### Process Items Panel
Displays process items based on the selected tab and applied filters:

1. **Status Tabs**: Switch between New, In-Progress, and Completed processes
2. **Process Items**: Each item shows:
   - Process title
   - Process type with color coding
   - Location
   - Date
   - Related object types (e.g., Nurse, Document, Physician)

### AI Assistant Panel
Interactive chat interface for analyzing the selected process:

1. **Chat History**: Displays the conversation between the user and the AI assistant
2. **Input Field**: Enter questions or requests for the AI assistant
3. **Send Button**: Submit your message to the AI assistant

### Process Analysis Panel
Displays detailed information about the selected process:

1. **Basic Information**:
   - Process Type
   - Location
   - Status
   - Date

2. **OCEL Insights**:
   - Event Count: Total number of events in the process
   - Average Path Length: Average duration of the process in hours
   - Bottleneck Activities: Activities identified as potential bottlenecks
   - Common Pathways: Frequently occurring sequences of activities

3. **Related Objects**:
   - Types of objects involved in the process (e.g., Patient, Document, Medication)
   - Object IDs

### Analysis Section
Text area for documenting analysis findings with options to:
- Export the analysis
- Publish the analysis to share with team members

## Workflow

### 1. Filter and Select a Process
1. Use the filters at the top to narrow down the list of processes
2. Select the appropriate tab (New, In-Progress, Completed)
3. Click on a process item to view its details

### 2. Review Process Details
1. Examine the basic information about the process
2. Review the OCEL insights to understand process performance
3. Check the related objects to understand the scope of the process

### 3. Interact with the AI Assistant
1. Ask questions about the process (e.g., "What are the main bottlenecks?")
2. Request recommendations for improvement
3. Inquire about specific aspects of the process

### 4. Document Your Analysis
1. Use the analysis text area to document your findings
2. Include AI-suggested improvements and your own insights
3. Export or publish your analysis when complete

### 5. Track Improvements
1. Move processes from New to In-Progress when work begins
2. Move processes to Completed when improvements are implemented
3. Compare metrics before and after improvements

## AI Capabilities

The AI assistant can provide insights on:

1. **Bottleneck Analysis**:
   - Identify activities that slow down the process
   - Quantify the impact of bottlenecks
   - Suggest ways to address bottlenecks

2. **Pathway Optimization**:
   - Analyze common process pathways
   - Identify inefficient paths
   - Suggest more efficient alternatives

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Identify resource constraints
   - Suggest optimal resource distribution
   - Recommend staffing adjustments

4. **Process Recommendations**:
   - Provide specific, actionable recommendations
   - Suggest process redesign opportunities
   - Offer best practices from similar processes

## Technical Details

### Data Model

The Root Cause Improvement Workflow uses an Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL) data model, which captures:

1. **Events**: Activities that occur during a process
2. **Objects**: Entities involved in the process (e.g., patients, documents)
3. **Relationships**: Connections between events and objects
4. **Timestamps**: When events occurred
5. **Attributes**: Additional information about events and objects

### Process Types

The system supports various healthcare process types:

1. **Reported Barriers**: Issues reported by staff that impede workflow
2. **Admission Process**: Patient intake and admission procedures
3. **Discharge Process**: Patient discharge and follow-up procedures
4. **Perioperative Process**: Surgical and perioperative workflows
5. **Patient Flow**: Movement of patients through the healthcare system
6. **Medication Process**: Medication ordering, dispensing, and administration

### Performance Metrics

The system tracks several key performance indicators:

1. **Event Count**: Total number of events in a process
2. **Average Path Length**: Average duration of the process in hours
3. **Bottleneck Impact**: Quantified impact of identified bottlenecks
4. **Patient Impact**: Number of patients affected by the process

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Review**: Schedule regular reviews of processes, especially those with high impact
2. **Collaborative Analysis**: Involve stakeholders from different roles in the analysis
3. **Incremental Improvement**: Focus on implementing small, manageable improvements
4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Base improvement decisions on the data and insights provided
5. **Follow-Up**: After implementing changes, review the process again to measure improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No processes appear in the list**:
   - Check that your filters aren't too restrictive
   - Verify that the date range includes relevant processes
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to view processes

2. **AI assistant doesn't provide specific answers**:
   - Be more specific in your questions
   - Select a process first before asking questions
   - Focus questions on the specific process selected

3. **Unable to export or publish analysis**:
   - Ensure you've selected a process
   - Make sure you've entered analysis text
   - Check your permissions for exporting and publishing
