# Nightingale Patient Product — Execution Log

**Initiative plan:**
[nightingale-patient-product-2026-07-26.md](../plans/nightingale-patient-product-2026-07-26.md)

## 2026-07-26 — Product direction and isolated development stream

### Decision record

Nightingale is the new dedicated patient product. Hummingbird is now the staff
operations product only. This is an architecture and product-identity decision, not a
clinical, patient-identity, content-release, pilot, database, migration, or production
deployment authorization.

### Completed evidence

- Created branch `codex/nightingale-patient-product` in a clean worktree at
  `/Users/sudoshi/Github/Zephyrus-nightingale-patient`, based on `origin/main` commit
  `446107ec`.
- Inspected the current independent staff targets (`net.acumenus.hummingbird`) and the
  legacy patient-reference targets (`net.acumenus.hummingbird.patient`) on both iOS and
  Android. The latter remain preserved as reference evidence and are not the Nightingale
  release target.
- Recorded supplied brand sources as RGBA 1254 × 1254 PNGs and pinned their SHA-256
  fingerprints in the initiative plan and product-specific provenance manifests.
- Added `scripts/brand/render-app-icon.swift`, a deterministic AppKit renderer. It created
  opaque iOS masters and Android density launcher derivatives, plus transparent Android
  adaptive-icon foregrounds with an 8% safe-zone inset. Hummingbird uses `#050B12` and
  Nightingale uses `#17120E` as reviewed opaque launcher backgrounds.
- Replaced the Hummingbird Staff iOS AppIcon/brand mark and Android
  launcher/round/foreground derivatives with the supplied hummingbird source. No legacy
  Hummingbird Patient asset or target was changed.
- Created the Nightingale iOS and Android roots, each with its own
  `net.acumenus.nightingale` application identity, unit/UI smoke tests, and an intentionally
  no-network, no-data foundation screen. The Android manifest has no `INTERNET` permission;
  its Gradle boundary task rejects staff product/endpoints. The iOS and Android boundary
  tests assert that live patient and staff endpoint access are disabled.
- Generated the Nightingale Xcode project from `project.yml`. The Nightingale iOS unit and
  UI tests pass on the booted iPhone 17 Pro simulator. Android unit/boundary tests and the
  API 35 (`hb`) emulator instrumentation smoke test pass. Android visual review captured
  the Nightingale Android 12+ splash and foundation screen, and the Hummingbird Staff splash.
- Verified Hummingbird Staff iOS project-generation drift and a Simulator Debug build. Its
  Android Debug APK builds, installs, and displays the supplied hummingbird mark on the
  Android 12+ splash surface.
- Confirmed the existing patient reference already has a distinct API, storage, and
  lifecycle boundary. That is useful migration input, not proof that the new Nightingale
  product is ready or authorized.

### Open work and holds

- Both Nightingale native targets now compile in Debug and Release, and both Hummingbird Staff
  targets compile in Debug and Release after the icon replacement. This does not satisfy
  signing, distribution, rights, or clinical/patient release requirements.
- Actual iOS launcher-surface inspection, Android round/adaptive launcher inspection, Android
  13+ monochrome-icon design, app-store/signing/rights release steps, and all clinical/patient
  authorization gates remain open. The current build and emulator evidence is only a
  foundation verification, not distribution approval.
- The existing patient contract remains governed compatibility input until a Nightingale
  contract/release migration is independently approved.
- No production patient, database record, session, grant, projection release, feature flag,
  migration, deployment, or pilot action was taken.
